Solana hackathon

# Circular Economy
## Frontend and Program(Smart contract) interaction

### Initialization
#### Pre-requisites (found in the prerequisite folder)
- config.yaml. 
  - Configuration file. To be placed as <user's-home-folder>/.config/solana/cli/config.yaml
- id.json. 
  - Payer wallet filled with SOL tokens. To be placed as <user's-home-folder>/.config/solana/id.json
- \*-keypair.json.
  - Program key file to derive program_id from. To be placed as dist/program/\*-keypair.json

#### Pre-requisites (to be generated at init time)
- For each component (e.g. LED-display, Pcb, Phone etc.), an address called PDA (Program derived address) has to be created and registsred on Solana. This PDA will be used as the address of the component when component is minted on Solana.
  - **For each component, use a different seed to derive unique PDAs.**
  - See code lines 191 - 224 in hello_mytoken.ts on how PDAs are generated and regsistered with Solana.
- Once PDAs are registsred, maintain a mapping of component_id <-> PDA in frontend state. Use this mapping to retrieve PDA of a component from its ID.
  - e.g. <component_id:PDA> (100: CojemWZsWiYng8vd7ghVeUWaz5MsNkRygosbdaEBouwv, 200: ByUBFLZKWo6xCv5w3m5vaF9ioUyuQJfi6CR94kvhPxGc)

### On-chain operations to manage component and product lifecycle
#### Mint a component
For each component to be minted on Solana:
- Parameters input by user:
  - Component ID (1 to 255)
  - Description (10 to 64 chars)
  - Serial no. (5 to 16 chars)
- Parameters set by client code: 
  - Set opcode to 100

Use web3js TransactionInstruction to send the mint request. In request, set pubkey(retrieve from component_id:PDA mapping) to PDA of the respective component.
See Class Component in hello_mytoken.js for how component data structure is typed. Note that types (e.g uint8) and string lengths have to be exactly maintained. 
See function createComponentQcom in hello_mytoken.ts for how minting is done.

#### Update a component
Each minted component can be updated. Only component's description can be updated as of now.
For each component to be updated on Solana:
- Parameters input by user:
  - Component ID (1 to 255)
  - New description (10 to 64 chars)
- Parameters set by client code: 
  - Set opcode to 101

Use web3js TransactionInstruction to send the mint request. In request, set pubkey to PDA (retrieve from component_id:PDA mapping) of the respective component.
See function updateComponentQcom in hello_mytoken.ts for how update is done.
**Note- Demo does not need update operation. So, ignore for demo.**


#### Read a component
Each component's latest state can be read from Solana.
To read a component's state:
- Parameters input by user:
  - Component ID (1 to 255)

Use web3js getAccountInfo to send the read request. In request, use PDA (retrieve from component_id:PDA mapping) of the respective component. 
See function reportComponentQcom in hello_mytoken.ts for how read is done.

#### Form child - parent relationship
Two components can be linked as child and parent.
To link two components:
- Parameters input by user:
  - Component IDs of the two components
- Parameters set by client code:
  - Set opcode to 102 

Use web3js TransactionInstruction to send the link request. In request, set PDAs (retrieve from component_id:PDA mapping) of the two components as follows:
```
// first PDA in array is child. second is parent.
[{pubkey: <PDA-of-child-component>, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
      {pubkey: <PDA-of-parent-component>, isSigner: false, isWritable: true}],
```      
See function addAsChild in hello_mytoken.ts for how linking is done.

### Intepret on-chain component data
Reading a component's state will return the following:
```
id;       // component's ID
description; // component's description
serial_no; // component's serial no.
parent;   // component ID of the parent of this component
children; // an array where each item is component ID of an child
```
Note: A component can have only one parent (parent's ID 1 to 255), or no parent (parent's ID 0) at any given time. It can have multiple children (max 10 children at any time)
